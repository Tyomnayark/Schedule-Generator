Optimization of Process Chain Scheduler

## Introduction
This project focuses on optimizing the performance of a process chain by maximizing a specific result and/or minimizing delays. The program reads a configuration file describing processes, analyzes the file, and proposes an optimized schedule based on priorities and resource availability. Additionally, a checker program is provided to validate the generated schedules.

## Getting Started

To run the program, you'll need install JDK to your system.

Compile the program:
```
javac StockExchangeProgram.java
```
Compile the checker program:
```
javac Checker.java
```
## Usage
Running the StockItem Exchange Program
Use the stock exchange program to generate optimized schedules based on the provided configuration files.
```
java StockExchangeProgram <file> <waiting_time>
```
- `<file>`: Path to the configuration file.

- `<waiting_time>`: Maximum time (in seconds) the program should run.

## Example:
```
java StockExchangeProgram example/simple/simple 10
```
Running the Checker Program

Use the checker program to validate the generated schedules.
```
java Checker <file> <log_file>
```
- `<file>`: Path to the configuration file.

- `<log_file>`: Path to the log file generated by the stock exchange program.

## Example:
```
java Checker example/simple/simple example/simple/simple.log

```
